# hello-world
First repository, figuring out GitHub

I'm going to make some more interesting changes.

What if I make an insertion locally...

Yeah, these are edits. Woo!

Single lines for sure--
although when we see the source--
they look like multiple.

...and make an addition remotely?

## New Stuff 2
Here's to changing multiple things in multiple commits. Will cherry-pick resolve this?
